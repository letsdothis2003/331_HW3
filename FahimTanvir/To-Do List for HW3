To-Do List for Chapter 3 hw3(sql file and video)

1. Look back at past lectures and chapter for new material. 
-Just to refresh with what was already learned, I looked back at all the materials we went over in the last few classes.

2. Read the textbook and reviewed the excercizes

- I read through chapter 3, which covered joins(cross, inner, outer, left, right, self)
-Skimmed thorugh and practices some of the problems in the end. 

3. Brainstored propositions that would make sense in a business sense. 
-I had to think how can I do something which would make sense for a company when it comes to their database. What would they do? Common idea was auditing records relating to sales and customers.


4.Write SQL Queries AND Tested them
- For each proposition, I wrote it in T-SQL and ran it in Microsoft server database. 
- For the joins, I wanted to reflect each one presented in the chapter, so I looked back at the excercises again just to see what I can work with. 
  

5.) Assist and consult group members
-Contacted everyone in my group to check each others files and answer any questions 

6.) Work with a partner and create the video
-We decided to split up, and work in pairs, in my case I worked with Justin to film the video. We both spent time on 10 queries in a almost 20 minute video going over 

7.)Create drive  for the group to upload everything
-I created the drive so everyone can upload all the mp4 files for submision.
