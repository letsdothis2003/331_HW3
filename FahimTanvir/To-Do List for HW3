To-Do List for Chapter 3 hw3(sql file and video)

1. Look back at past lectures and chapter for new material. 
-Just to refresh with what was already learned, I looked back at all the materials we went over in the last few classes.



2. Read the textbook and reviewed the excercizes

- I read through chapter 3, which covered joins(cross, inner, outer, left, right, self)
-Skimmed thorugh and practices some of the problems in the end. 



3. Brainstored propositions that would make sense in a business sense. 
-I had to think how can I do something which would make sense for a company when it comes to their database. What would they do? Common idea was auditing records relating to sales and customers.


4.Write SQL Queries AND Tested them
- For each proposition, I wrote it in T-SQL and ran it in Microsoft server database. 
- For the joins, I wanted to reflect each one presented in the chapter, so I looked back at the excercises again just to see what I can work with. 
  

5.)Document and video
-Spent like a minute per recording, explained syntax and bussiness importance. 

6.) Assist and consult group members
-Contacted everyone in my group to check each others files and answer any questions
