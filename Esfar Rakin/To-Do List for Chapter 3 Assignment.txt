To-Do List for Chapter 3 Assignment (Showcase in Video)

1. Read the Chapter

   - I started by reading Chapter 3: Multi-Table Queries (Joins)** from *T-SQL Fundamentals.
   - My goal was to understand every join type: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF, and Multi-joins.



2. Review the Exercises

   - I looked at the sample queries and exercises provided in the book and homework files.
   - I practiced running them to see how results change when I used INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN, etc.
   - This gave me a foundation before creating my own propositions.


3. Set Up the Database

   - I explored the key tables: `Sales.Customers`, `Sales.Orders`, `Application.People`, `Warehouse.StockItems`, and `Purchasing.Suppliers`.
   - I made sure I understood the relationships between these tables.


4. Formulate 10 Propositions

   - I created 10 original questions/problems that could be solved with joins.
   - Each proposition reflects a real business scenario.


5.Write SQL Queries

   - For each proposition, I wrote the JOIN query in T-SQL.
   - I tested them in DBeaver to make sure they ran correctly.


6. Document Explanations

   - For each query, I explained 4 parts:

     1. What it does
     2. How I did it
     3. Why it’s special
     4. Business importance
   - This makes it easy to present and ensures clarity for non-technical viewers.



7. Connect to NACE Competencies

   * I highlighted which **career readiness skills I used:

     -Critical Thinking → writing propositions and debugging queries.
     -Technology → using SQL Server & joins.
     -Communication → explaining results clearly.
     -Teamwork → preparing my part for the group project.
     -Equity & Inclusion** → ensuring all entities (customers/suppliers) are represented with LEFT JOINs.


8. Create the Presentation (MP4)

   - I prepared my script so I can explain each proposition confidently.
   - I recorded my screen showing queries and results.
   - I explained each one in plain language, step by step.
