To Do List
1. Read through Chapter 3
  -I read through the chapter, and learned about the different types of joins (CROSS JOIN, INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN), and then skimmed through the exercises for the chapter.
2. Explore the Database
  -Using DBeaver, I examined the different tables from different schemas in the database "WideWorldImporters", and checked to see what types of queries I could generate using joins.
  -I experimented a bit with the database, and created a few test queries to see what type of results would be outputted.
3. Write 10 propositions and 10 SQL queries
  -I came up with 10 propositions, and then made a query for each of them. I made sure that each query utilizes material that I learned from chapter 3 of T-SQL Fundamentals. 
  -I ran each query to make sure that the output matches my original proposition. 
  -Using Azure Data Studio, I saved all of my propositions, queries, and reasons why I think each query is special, into a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
4. Record Presentation of proposition and queries
  -I recorded an mp4 video capturing my screen. In the recording I explain each proposition and query, and also why I think each query is useful.
  -In my presentation, I show the rows of data that are outputted from each query.
